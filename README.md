# Distributed Database System (Go + MariaDB + Streamlit)

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a **Distributed Database System** using **Go**, **MariaDB**, **mysql**, and **Python (Streamlit)**. The system follows a **Master-Snap architecture** where:

- The **Master node** acts as the central authority:
  - Handles database creation, table creation, and deletion.
  - Manages centralized query execution.
  - Synchronizes data with Snap nodes.
  - Hosts a **Streamlit GUI** to send SQL commands and view results.

- The **Snap nodes** are terminal-based clients:
  - Interact directly with users via a CLI.
  - Support **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, **SELECT ALL**, and **SEARCH** operations.
  - Perform **bidirectional replication**, meaning any change on a Snap node is:
    - Executed locally,
    - Sent to the Master,

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### ‚úÖ Master Node
- Creates the `MOST` database and tables.
- Deletes databases/tables (only allowed on Master).
- Executes and logs queries.
- Hosts a **Streamlit interface** to allow SQL command input.
- Can **export** the entire database as a `.sql` file using `mysqldump`.
- Sends `.sql` snapshots to Snap nodes upon request (initial sync).

### ‚úÖ Snap Node
- Terminal-based interface with the following operations:
  - `1 - INSERT`
  - `2 - UPDATE`
  - `3 - DELETE`
  - `4 - SELECT ALL`
  - `5 - SEARCH`
  - `6 - Exit`
- Allows dynamic table selection with a **Back** option to return to the main menu.
- Automatically receives the database dump from the Master on first connection.
- Sends every DML operation to Master and other Snaps for **bidirectional sync**.

## üîÑ Replication Model

- **Initial Sync**: On startup, a Snap node connects to the Master and receives a `.sql` dump, which is imported locally.
- **Bidirectional Replication**:
  - Any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation on **any node** (Master or Snap):
    - Executes locally.
    - Is sent to the Master.
    - Is broadcasted to all connected Snap nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Go**: Core language for Master and Snap communication.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for data storage.
- **Streamlit (Python)**: For GUI interface on Master.
- **TCP Sockets**: Used for communication between Master and Snap nodes.
